# Benjamin Industrial Data Lab

This repository is the root laboratory for building reproducible industrial data engineering pipelines.

Core principles:
- Infrastructure as code
- Deterministic builds
- Verifiable deployment artifacts
- Signed or auditable production evidence

This lab will contain multiple projects, each with:
- Version-pinned infrastructure
- CI-generated artifacts
- Monitoring and uptime evidence
- Verification bundles suitable for employer or academic review
